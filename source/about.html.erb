   <p>The Generations Project grew out of a desire to engage across geographic and generational boundary lines. Born in New York City but nationwide in scope, the initial Generations Project brought together Millennials, Gen Xers, and Baby Boomers from locations as diverse as California, Tennessee, Queens, and Kansas.</p>

   <p>This group is inspired by the conviction that most political divisions are only as strong as you allow them to be. Their documentary and webshort work challenges the divisive rhetoric that separates age and geographic groups.</p>

   <p>The next phase of the Generations Project is to multiply the work of this group across locations and participants. To learn more about this process or to consider taking part, please visit the <a href= "partner.html.erb">Partner</a> page.
