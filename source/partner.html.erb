   <p><h2><b>Digitally:</b></h2>
     You have the vision; we have your digital back! For a digital partnership, we'll have a conversation about what your vision is for your panel, workshop, or other conversational event. We'll provide advice and designs for some promotional materials, and youâ€™ll put it together! Let's combine our voices, and help you forward collaboration in your neck of the woods. <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/generationsproj/"target= "_blank">Let's move forward!</a>
   </p>

   <p><h2><b>In-Person:</b></h2>
     We're excited to  come to you to act as facilitators for your workshop or panel! In the spirit of the Generations Project itself, we would love to co-facilitate your panel, workshop, or other conversational event. Over the course of a few conversations, we can figure out together what you want and need from this event or event series, and how we might help. We'll provide some promotional materials; you get the space and the crowd. Then, we'll come to you to help you host the day-of and ensure a productive (but not necessarily <i>easy</i>) conversational event. <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/generationsproj/"target= "_blank">Get in touch!</a>
   </p>

   <p><h2><b>In Media:</b></h2>
     If you run a podcast, YouTube, or other media outlet, we would love to join you to talk about the Generations Project, its goals, and its implications. <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/generationsproj/"target= "_blank">Reach out to us</a>; it would be awesome to have a conversation!
